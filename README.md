# Car-accident-severity

Introduction/Business Problem:
Road safety is a very important topic around the world, and in the United Kingdom it's no different. Each year thousands of accidents are reported to the police and details such as accident severity, location, date, weather, road conditions, and number of causalities are recorded.

Data:
There are three datasets to be analyzed: Accident information from 2017, Casualty information from 2017, and Vehicle information from 2017. These files are freely available for download on data.gov.uk. The goal is to make roads safer for everyone by digging into common denominators and using visualization to make sense of the data.
